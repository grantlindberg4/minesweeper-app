How to play:

- Tap a cell on the board to reveal it. This will also reveal all vacant spaces around it.
- Tap the 'New Game' button to be given a chance to reset the game
- You win by revealing all cells except for the mines

Tips and hints:

- Your first choice is guaranteed to be safe
- The number that appears on a revealed square indicates the number of mines around it
- Cells that are a darker gray means that they have already been revealed
- There are a total of 10 mines on the board per game
- The game will record the number of moves and the time you spend in each game

Note: This implementation does NOT include flagging, so the user will be unable to place a flag indicating a possible mine.
